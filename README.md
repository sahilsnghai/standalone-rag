# RAG Project

This project is a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application built using several technologies including Langchain, LangGraph, Streamlit UI, FastAPI, and Qdrant.

## Overview

The application is designed to enhance information retrieval and generation by integrating various components that work together to provide efficient and accurate results.

## Technologies Used

- **Langchain**: A framework for building applications with language models.
- **LangGraph**: A tool for managing and visualizing language model workflows.
- **Streamlit**: A framework for building interactive web applications.
- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **Qdrant**: A vector search engine for efficient similarity search.

## Project Structure

- **api/**: Contains the FastAPI application code.
- **db/**: Database models and repository code.
- **src/**: Core logic including embedding, retrieval, and evaluation.
- **ui/**: Streamlit application for the user interface.
- **utils/**: Utility functions and configurations.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sahilsnghai/standalone-rag
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python run_app.py
   ```

## Usage

- Access the Streamlit UI to interact with the application.
- Use the FastAPI endpoints for programmatic access.
